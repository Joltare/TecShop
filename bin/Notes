I had a lot more working with the main screen saving to and loading from a ProductList.xml file but i messed up the code and couldnt fix it in time.

My plan was a computer hardware store where you can login / register once logged in if you had admin access the the main screen would allow you to add remove and edit stock in the inventory.

With just customer access you would have been able to browse items in stock and add them to a basket with a checkout option which would add items and give a reciept.

The video you posted on moodle for the scene changes in javafx was by a guy named Jaret Wright i got most of my ideas inspiratrion from his github.
